# Decentralized_Betting
/*
 The files contain Smart Contracts written in Solidity language to implement a process of Betting in a decentralised way - that is, without   the involvement of any third party.
  The betted amount is collected in the smart contract and when it is deployed, a winner is chosen who gets the total amount stored in the      Smart Contract i.e. the winning amount.
